Ola Data Analyst:

Steps:

1. We have downloaded the dataset with the given prompt with help of ChatGPT.

2. We have loaded the dataset in MySQL/MS-SQL and solved business problems which can give insights 

3. From that loaded data, we have connected the dataset to PowerBI for dashboarding & reporting purpose to share the insights to stakeholders.

-----------------

Actual steps:

1. We have cleaned our dataset using Excel by selecting all & removing duplicates in data tab

2. After that, we have loaded the data in MS-SQL using Import flat files and imported the CSV file(prev. Excel file)

3. Post which we have setup the SQL Server Authentication and solved business queries using SQL.

4. After doing analysis, we have directly imported our data in Power BI from our SQL Server DB using SQL Server Creds.

5. Post which the data was loaded successfully into Power BI.


Challenges:

In SQL server express edition, due to non availability of SSIS, the excel files can't be imported.
It can only be done in Developer Version of SSMS.

Hence, with the use of importing flat files/CSV, we converted our dataset in CSV from excel and then imported, and the record count comes out to be same.
